## Anomaly_Detection

## Tracking point anomalies using LSTM architecture. 

The structure of the code is as follows:

1.	Fetches information from mysql table which tells from where data will be fetched. 
2.	The program then fetches data from the database and table from googleâ€™s BigQuery, where it has been stored. 
3.	It first checks if the model for the existing database is available or not. 
4.	If the model is not available, it creates a new model by having a series of data processing and transformations and ultimately passing through LSTM model architecture.

5.	But if the model is available it checks 2 things:
      
      a.	If the age of the model is more than 5 days old:
            Then it trains from the latest data and then updates the existing model- by adding the new weights to the old model.
      b.	If the age of the model is less than 5 days old
          	Then it predicts and outputs the result and displays anomaly. 
            
6.	Finally throwing the output in a dataframe format to a MySQL database.
